## Research: 5 hours
I am completely inexperienced in 3D printing (I don't even have one ðŸ¥² like not even a cheapo one ðŸ˜…) so obviously spent a good amount of time (way too much) researching how it works! The maker mash-up tutorial seemed quite detailed and helpful.

Here is some research that I did after reviwing AK printer'S documentation which came in clutch:

- https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Design-and-Build-a-3D-Printer/
- https://kingroon.com/blogs/3d-print-101/cartesian-vs-corexy
- https://reprap.org/wiki/Build_A_RepRap
- https://www.instructables.com/Complete-newbie-step-by-step-3D-printer-with-all-p/
- https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/FFF.html
- https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/mondrian-customisable-reprap-3d-printer-07-12-2015/
- https://reprap.org/wiki/Choosing_a_Power_Supply_for_your_RepRap

  Overall, it helped me gathering references and brainstorming ideas and I also screenshot various reference images for the guides to help me out later while making my 3d printer. 

## Build Log



- Then made a BOM:
- 10 hours !!!!!!
- Sourced AliExpress parts:  BMG extruder, linear rails, belts. Was extremely hard to stay in budget, hit $300. Therefore I had to sctrahc of the the idea of adding LED lighting and custom enclosure panels for my 3d printer.

After most of the parts where sourced I worked on getting a bit of underdstanding on how the 3d printer is actually supposed to be put together before actually doing by making sketch (really rough - yes, I know my handwrithing is horrible).

Making of the cad:

Getting organized was the first step. I created a new project workspace in Fusion360. For the extursion, cad parts, etx. I designed them in a different fusion360 file and then added then in to the main file. Slowly bring my hand-drawn sketches into alive!
The frame is the backbone of the printer (Frame = backbone = MUST be solid.), so I invested significant time. Luckly I didn't need to design them from scratch as I was able to download the exturstion in the .dfx format and then adjust it too my size whihch helped me save some time in the desiging process.


- Slowly I progressed my way through added custom mounting features such as slots. Used the fusions360 align feature to make sure the fitted perfectly.
- Then progressed with adding NEMA 17 stepper motors on the its mounts
