# 3D Printer Design: CAD & PCB Documentation

**Project Status:** Design Phase Complete (Pre-Assembly)  
**Total Design Hours:** 50 hours  

Reseach: 5 hours
I am completely inexperienced in 3D printer (I don't even have one ðŸ¥²) so obviously spent a good amount of time (way too much) researching on how it works! The maker mash-up tutorial seemed quite detial and helpful.

Here is some research that I did, other than that (from AK printer'S documentation):

Then made a BOM:
10 hours !!!!!!
Sourced AliExpress parts: clone BMG extruder, linear rails, belts. Was extremely hard to stay in budget, hit $300. Therefore deferred LED lighting and enclosure panels.
